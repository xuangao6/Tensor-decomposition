# This is the repository for tensor decomposition

## Project Description
In this assignment,  we use the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) and the block-term decomposition (BTD) to discover task-related components within the brain, i.e., the regions which were activated by the stimulus task. Two of these regions are the LGN and the visual cortex, but you will also notice some large blood vessels reacting to the stimulus in the correlation image. The instruction document is [here](./AnalyzingFunctionalUltrasoundImagesUsingTensorDecompositions.pdf). The report can be found [here](./report-tensor-decomposition.pdf).
